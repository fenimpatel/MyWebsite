My website address for Assignment 3: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~fpatel/index.html or http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~fpatel/assignment_3/index.html. 
I modified my assignment 2's index.html file and I added style.css file to assignment 2, so that there is a navigation bar which has a link to 
assignment 3 from my assignment 2's index.html file. To view my assignment 3 go to http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~fpatel/index.html then click on 
Assignment 3 in the navigation bar on the left side or to view my assignment 3 go to http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~fpatel/assignment_3/index.html. 
I validated my assignment 3's index.html file which was provided by Professor Zhou againt the W3C Markup Validation (http://validator.w3.org/) 
and the HTML5 Living Validator (http://validator.nu/). I validated my assignment 3's modified pacific.css file against the W3C CSS Validation 
Service (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). I validated my assignment 2's index.html file against the W3C Markup Validation 
(http://validator.w3.org/) and the HTML5 Living Validator (http://validator.nu/). I validated my added style.css file to assignment 2 against 
the W3C CSS Validation Service (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp as a reference 
to help me with background properties. And I used https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_list-style.asp as a reference to help me with list-style 
properties.
